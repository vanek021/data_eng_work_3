The harmonious juxtaposition of creaminess and lees enrichment with bright, juicy citricity and of expansive richness with levity is stunning....Citrus zest notes segue seamlessly into the fine stream of CO2 without bitterness, while succulent white peach garlanded in lily-of-the-valley is laced with rich, subtly piquant nut oils and saliva-liberating salinity. Emerging suggestions of shitake and shrimp shell reduction compound the sense of capital-'U' umami in a vibrantly interactive and refreshing finish. A day after opening, this is even more vividly complex than it had been initially, with hints of fresh red raspberry lending an invigorating tang and sensation of berry seed-crunching that delivers strikingly harmonious counterpoint to both the luscious brightness of fruit and the nutty low-tones....The team at Krug has long taken pains to emphasize that the task of assembling their Grande Cuvee from a hundred or more lots reflecting reserves of widely varying ages is mind-bogglingly complex.

The harmonious juxtaposition of creaminess and lees enrichment with bright, juicy citricity and of expansive richness with levity is stunning....Citrus zest notes segue seamlessly into the fine stream of CO2 without bitterness, while succulent white peach garlanded in lily-of-the-valley is laced with rich, subtly piquant nut oils and saliva-liberating salinity. Emerging suggestions of shitake and shrimp shell reduction compound the sense of capital-'U' umami in a vibrantly interactive and refreshing finish. A day after opening, this is even more vividly complex than it had been initially, with hints of fresh red raspberry lending an invigorating tang and sensation of berry seed-crunching that delivers strikingly harmonious counterpoint to both the luscious brightness of fruit and the nutty low-tones....The team at Krug has long taken pains to emphasize that the task of assembling their Grande Cuvee from a hundred or more lots reflecting reserves of widely varying ages is mind-bogglingly complex.

The harmonious juxtaposition of creaminess and lees enrichment with bright, juicy citricity and of expansive richness with levity is stunning....Citrus zest notes segue seamlessly into the fine stream of CO2 without bitterness, while succulent white peach garlanded in lily-of-the-valley is laced with rich, subtly piquant nut oils and saliva-liberating salinity. Emerging suggestions of shitake and shrimp shell reduction compound the sense of capital-'U' umami in a vibrantly interactive and refreshing finish. A day after opening, this is even more vividly complex than it had been initially, with hints of fresh red raspberry lending an invigorating tang and sensation of berry seed-crunching that delivers strikingly harmonious counterpoint to both the luscious brightness of fruit and the nutty low-tones....The team at Krug has long taken pains to emphasize that the task of assembling their Grande Cuvee from a hundred or more lots reflecting reserves of widely varying ages is mind-bogglingly complex. So is the result.”"

Chef de cave Julie remembers following the great 1996 Verzenay reserve wine in the tanks since the onset of her Krug career in 2006, and she says she felt emotional when the time came to include it in the 2012 blend as its oldest component among the 42% of reserve wines.

Refined yet expressive nose with richness of ripe stone fruits, candied lemon, baked apple and ginger reaching the nose first, followed by a gentle spiciness for fresh oak wood. Time in the glass brings forward layers of charismatic and complex brioche, yeast and honeycomb tones. On the palate it is even surprisingly tight and focused, with its brisk, saline acidity lining the fine, ripe and pure fruitiness.

Even if this is more open out of the gates than the 2011-based 167ème edition, the 168ème edition is also the more concentrated and intense of the two. It's based on the 2012 harvest, complemented by fully 42% reserve wines—a blend of 198 wines from 11 different vintages dating back to 1996.”"

In between these mighty parts we have steel tank-aged Tauxières, Avenay and Verzenay from the lighter and more mineral-influenced vintages of 2016 and 2017.

The principal cru is Verzenay although there are also wines from Aÿ, Bouzy and Tauxières in the blend. Each new edition will focus on a different cru. Good information on the back label.\nVery Bollinger (even more than Pinot Noir) on the nose, but livelier than the regular NV. Very fine texture and bead indeed on the palate. A little (not excessive) oaky note on the end. A very fine, elegant, well-integrated interpretation of Pinot Noir. Long peacock's-tail finish. Very accomplished. Though it's arguably too complex to be a suitable aperitif. A champagne for geeks?”"

                "note": "“A fabulous Champagne, the NV PN VZ 15 is a new wine from Bollinger and the first addition to the range in over a decade. As the name implies, it is a 100% Pinot Noir built on a core of fruit from Verzenay and based on the 2015 vintage. Bollinger’s most iconic wine is of course the super-rare and expensive 100% Pinot Noir Vielles Vignes Françaises. A few years ago, Bollinger set out on a path to exalt the unique characteristics of their Pinot. For this project, the four leads of the winemaking team headed by Cellar Master Gilles Descôtes and Deputy Cellar Master Denis Bunner were tasked with each creating a new cuvée. The conditions: the wine had to be non-vintage, 100% Pinot Noir and possible to offer at both an affordable price and with some scale. The four wines were tasted blind and the winner is the new PN VZ 15, the first in a series of upcoming releases that will explore the many shades of Pinot at Bollinger. I tasted it recently with Bunner and General Manager Charles-Armand de Belenet and was super impressed.\n\nBright and vibrant on the palate, the PN VZ 15 captures all of the Pinot richness that is such a Bollinger signature but with the freshness and verve that make Pinots from Verzenay so distinctive. Rich red fruit, mint, dried flower and spice notes play off bright acids and veins of saline-drenched minerals in a display of aromas, flavors and textures that dazzle all the senses. Think of it as a baby VVF, but with the tension of Verzenay. The blend is approximately 50% Verzenay and 50% Aÿ, Bouzy and Louvois, done about half in steel and half in oak. This release is based on the 2015 vintage (50% of the blend), with reserve wines that go back to 2009, including 20% from the reserve magnums Bollinger is so famous for. This bottle was disgorged in November 2019 and dosage is 7 grams per liter, about average for Bollinger today.\n\nAs I have written before, many of Champagne’s big houses have embraced the ambitious spirit of grower Champagne with their recent bottlings, wines that often place more emphasis on variety and place than the flagship blended cuvées that are the core of what Champagne has represented in the past. This is yet another example. The new PN VZ 15 is superb, and sharply priced as well, something that is not often the case with new grande marque Champagnes these days. Don’t miss it. ”"

Launched in UK 20 June 2019. Priced the same as the rosé retail, and very slightly more than the rosé in the on trade.\nGreenish lemon yellow. Tiny little bead. 2012 is very concentrated because it was such as a small harvest and 2009 had lots of fruit and freshness. They don’t want a hard finish since there’s zero dosage. Lightly reductive and very Laurent-Perrier on the nose. Tight and delicate. The same texture as Grand Siècle. Very long and tightly knit. A little brother for Grand Siècle? Splits the difference between a house and a grower’s champagne.”"

This particular cuvée of the famous rosé champagne in the flask bottle is based on 2013. It's made from Pinot exclusively from 10 of the finest villages including Ambonnay, Bouzy, Louvois, Aÿ and the house's home patch of Tours-sur-Marne. It also includes 15% of reserve wine back to 2010 and spends all of 5.5 years on the lees, much longer than most NV rosés. Disgorged in September 2019 with a dosage of 10 g/l. They cold-macerate the grapes for two to three days, depending on the year, with the aim of extracting red-berry fruit flavours specifically rather than being concerned about the colour.\nPretty deep intensity of a colour that looks like pale tomato juice. Rose-petal aromas. Pretty aggressive mousse and light tannins on the end. This is quite an assertive pink champagne. It's not going to keep quiet as you enjoy your Valentine's dinner but may do a certain amount of interrupting. Red-berry fruit certainly in evidence before the tannins.

Highest malo ever: 56%. Reserve wines constitute 25% (which is the norm). This includes 7% really old wines. Usually there are eight vintages, in this case back to 2004 maybe aged in old oak plus 18% from the year before in stainless steel. Their role is to add consistency. Typically, there will be 120 different batches of wine in Brut Premier.\nFlirtatious and lively. Mouth-filling and satisfying. Dancing and lively. A very superior NV champagne.\nDrink 2017-2024”"

It takes a mere 5% of Pinot Noir wine from Verzenay and Aÿ to give this its desired colour (salmon, with delicate peachy hues) and character. The fine nose is characterised by pristine red fruitiness playfully intermingling with spicy complexity and mineral whiffs. Still primary in fruitiness, it comes with depth and complexity. The oak takes a supporting role, leaving the delicious Pinot fruit to the fore, and the well-built, muscular palate has a degree of vinosity. This is a non-vintage rosé that is worthy of ageing.

The concept behind the Brut Collection is the opposite: we're looking for freshness—and we are embracing singularity, something we're emphasizing by enumerating each year's blend.\" This project has been in the making since 2012, when Lecaillon set aside 21,000 liters of wine to constitute a perpetual reserve aged in large tanks without malolactic fermentation. Sourcing has evolved too: less must is coming from cooperatives, and only vineyards cultivated without the use of herbicides inform the blend. A dedicated team oversees all this, visiting every grower three times per year. And vinification is parcel by parcel to deliver a maximum of blending components. Iteration 242 is based on the 2017 vintage (56%), supplemented by 34% reserve wines from the perpetual reserve established in 2012 and 10% foudre-aged reserve wines.\n\nSo much for the composition and concept of the new NV Brut Collection 242, but how does it taste? This debut release is very impressive indeed, wafting from the glass with notes of pear, peach, ripe citrus fruit, toasted almonds, fresh pastry and white flowers. Medium to full-bodied, pillowy and textural, it's concentrated and layered, with lively acids, an enlivening pinpoint mousse and a long, sapid finish. Brut Premier was already a very persuasive wine, but the new Brut Collection nevertheless represents a step up.”"

                "note": "“The NV Collection 242 is a new wine from Roederer that replaces the Brut Premier in the range. The Collection (which now will be numbered by harvest) is a blend of three components: a perpetual reserve done in the classic non-malo Roederer style, reserve wines in oak with a touch of malo, and a base vintage, in this case 2017. That blend results in a NV Champagne that offers lovely richness and resonance, with plenty of yellow orchard fruit and floral character. Whereas Brut Premier was typically a focused, nervy wine that, while consistently excellent, also was not always in line with the Roederer house style, the 242 tastes more like a Roederer Champagne in terms of its complexity. Incidentally, there is no Vintage, Cristal or Cristal Rosé in 2017, so all the best lots went into this bottling. Dosage is 8 grams per liter, so lower than the 9 or so that was typical for recent Brut Premier and much lower than the 12-13 that was once customary. The 242 was also bottled with a bit less sugar than the norm, which results in lower atmospheres of pressure in the bottle and silkier texture.\n\n“Brut Premier was created in the late 1970s and 1980s, when we struggled to ripen,” Chef de Caves Jean-Baptiste Lecaillon explained. “It was our way of compensating for lack of ripeness in the field and the variability of quality across vintages. Because of climate change, achieving ripeness is not an issue today. Instead, our challenge is maintaining freshness and precision. For that reason, we decided to re-think our NV and start from a place of positive rather than negative selection.””"

The packaging is extremely similar to that of Brut Premier. Scannable QR code on the back label for more information. Roederer's notes: '2017, the base vintage for Collection 242, was a year of living dangerously! An exceptionally warm and dry winter and spring, but the latter brought severe frosts from 17 to 29 April, setting the sorry record for 12 nights of frost. These were followed by a dull, wet and not particularly hot summer, which ended in an almost tropical (hot and humid) spell at the end of August. This sudden change led to a significant increase in grey rot on the ripening Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier grapes. The harvest was fast-paced and completed very quickly, demanding precise and methodical selection work, of an unprecedented level even for Roederer. The harvest took place from 31 August to 9 September 2017. A third each from the Vallée de la Marne, the Côte des Blancs and the Montagne de Reims. 42% Chardonnay (the most successful variety in 2017), 36% Pinot Noir, 22% Pinot Meunier. Only 34% went through malo.' Dosage is 8 g/l (whereas Brut Premier used to be 9 g/l).\n\"Deep straw colour and tiny, tiny bead. Really satisfying, complete, beautifully balanced nose with some evolution and richness. A little bit of toastiness and it tastes pretty ripe. Very different indeed from a Brut Zéro champagne! Firm. Some tasters may object to the dosage. But it's a beautiful wine.\"”"

Crucially this cuvée is almost based on a reserve system rather than a year, with 50% of the blend coming from Peters' perpetual reserve and the remainder from the 2019 vintage. It is in quite superb form, based on a vintage Rodolph Peters may be the best of the last 20 years. Delicate layers of fresh fruit – pear, pineapple, clementine – are far from obvious, tucked into a palate saturated with pure Côte des Blancs energy from the reserves. This remains one of the benchmark NV Blanc de Blancs, at its best with up to five years in the cellar.”"

The concept behind the Brut Collection is the opposite: we're looking for freshness—and we are embracing singularity, something we're emphasizing by enumerating each year's blend.\" This project has been in the making since 2012, when Lecaillon set aside 21,000 liters of wine to constitute a perpetual reserve aged in large tanks without malolactic fermentation. Sourcing has evolved too: less must is coming from cooperatives, and only vineyards cultivated without the use of herbicides inform the blend. A dedicated team oversees all this, visiting every grower three times per year. And vinification is parcel by parcel to deliver a maximum of blending components. Iteration 242 is based on the 2017 vintage (56%), supplemented by 34% reserve wines from the perpetual reserve established in 2012 and 10% foudre-aged reserve wines.\n\nSo much for the composition and concept of the new NV Brut Collection 242, but how does it taste? This debut release is very impressive indeed, wafting from the glass with notes of pear, peach, ripe citrus fruit, toasted almonds, fresh pastry and white flowers. Medium to full-bodied, pillowy and textural, it's concentrated and layered, with lively acids, an enlivening pinpoint mousse and a long, sapid finish. Brut Premier was already a very persuasive wine, but the new Brut Collection nevertheless represents a step up.”"

                "note": "“The NV Collection 242 is a new wine from Roederer that replaces the Brut Premier in the range. The Collection (which now will be numbered by harvest) is a blend of three components: a perpetual reserve done in the classic non-malo Roederer style, reserve wines in oak with a touch of malo, and a base vintage, in this case 2017. That blend results in a NV Champagne that offers lovely richness and resonance, with plenty of yellow orchard fruit and floral character. Whereas Brut Premier was typically a focused, nervy wine that, while consistently excellent, also was not always in line with the Roederer house style, the 242 tastes more like a Roederer Champagne in terms of its complexity. Incidentally, there is no Vintage, Cristal or Cristal Rosé in 2017, so all the best lots went into this bottling. Dosage is 8 grams per liter, so lower than the 9 or so that was typical for recent Brut Premier and much lower than the 12-13 that was once customary. The 242 was also bottled with a bit less sugar than the norm, which results in lower atmospheres of pressure in the bottle and silkier texture.\n\n“Brut Premier was created in the late 1970s and 1980s, when we struggled to ripen,” Chef de Caves Jean-Baptiste Lecaillon explained. “It was our way of compensating for lack of ripeness in the field and the variability of quality across vintages. Because of climate change, achieving ripeness is not an issue today. Instead, our challenge is maintaining freshness and precision. For that reason, we decided to re-think our NV and start from a place of positive rather than negative selection.””"

The packaging is extremely similar to that of Brut Premier. Scannable QR code on the back label for more information. Roederer's notes: '2017, the base vintage for Collection 242, was a year of living dangerously! An exceptionally warm and dry winter and spring, but the latter brought severe frosts from 17 to 29 April, setting the sorry record for 12 nights of frost. These were followed by a dull, wet and not particularly hot summer, which ended in an almost tropical (hot and humid) spell at the end of August. This sudden change led to a significant increase in grey rot on the ripening Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier grapes. The harvest was fast-paced and completed very quickly, demanding precise and methodical selection work, of an unprecedented level even for Roederer. The harvest took place from 31 August to 9 September 2017. A third each from the Vallée de la Marne, the Côte des Blancs and the Montagne de Reims. 42% Chardonnay (the most successful variety in 2017), 36% Pinot Noir, 22% Pinot Meunier. Only 34% went through malo.' Dosage is 8 g/l (whereas Brut Premier used to be 9 g/l).\n\"Deep straw colour and tiny, tiny bead. Really satisfying, complete, beautifully balanced nose with some evolution and richness. A little bit of toastiness and it tastes pretty ripe. Very different indeed from a Brut Zéro champagne! Firm. Some tasters may object to the dosage. But it's a beautiful wine.\"”"

The overall note is charmingly, sweetly fruity, with an impeccable ground coffee tone adding layers. A complex mix of yellow and red fruit, but there is also a dark spiciness giving an element of interest. The palate is generous, with an age-mellowed velvety texture.

The beautifully expressive nose oozes Pinot Noir's sweet and spicy strawberry and blood orange fruit. Laurent-Perrier truly does master the maceration method of making rosé, achieving an amazing textural silkiness and structural tension without ever showing too much tannin or bitterness.

This particular cuvée of the famous rosé champagne in the flask bottle is based on 2013. It's made from Pinot exclusively from 10 of the finest villages including Ambonnay, Bouzy, Louvois, Aÿ and the house's home patch of Tours-sur-Marne. It also includes 15% of reserve wine back to 2010 and spends all of 5.5 years on the lees, much longer than most NV rosés. Disgorged in September 2019 with a dosage of 10 g/l. They cold-macerate the grapes for two to three days, depending on the year, with the aim of extracting red-berry fruit flavours specifically rather than being concerned about the colour.\nPretty deep intensity of a colour that looks like pale tomato juice. Rose-petal aromas. Pretty aggressive mousse and light tannins on the end. This is quite an assertive pink champagne. It's not going to keep quiet as you enjoy your Valentine's dinner but may do a certain amount of interrupting. Red-berry fruit certainly in evidence before the tannins. Not my personal favourite style but it's certainly true to the ordained style and a lot of care goes into making it.\nDrink 2021 – 2024”"
